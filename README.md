# README
This is a project to make an easily accessible database of all course equivalencies across universties worldwide in order to make it easier for exchange students to choose the courses at their host universities and get them counted at their home universities.

The database is planned to be crowdsourced.  

The project is planned to be done in Ruby on Rails. 

The data is planned to be stored in BSON in MongoDB.
